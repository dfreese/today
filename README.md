_Today at work we talked about..._

  

It is hard to describe coding design and strategy without context.  You end up with fake examples.

So instead, I'm writing down "guideline-like" thoughts and discussions _as they happen_ in our real-world code.

This means many examples will talk about objects and classes that you might not know about (ie what is a `Channel`?).
I'm not going to explain these classes any more than necessary, hopefully not at all.
But I still think you can glean more meaning from these examples than from `Foo` and `Bar` examples.
(And, I suspect you can guess, for example, that a `ChannelManager` is a class that manages channels, whatever channels are.)
